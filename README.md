# R Shiny interface for GDELT

GDELT monitors the world's news media in print, broadcast and web in 100+ languages. Monitoring uses machine-translation, so you can search globally in English for local-language content. Images are processed to capture identifiable features and text. Locations mentioned in content are geolocated.
